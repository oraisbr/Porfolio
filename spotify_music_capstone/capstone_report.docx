Capstone Project Summary

This capstone project demonstrates the application of data science and analytical research methods to solve a real-world problem using structured data. The project follows an end-to-end workflow, beginning with problem definition and data acquisition and concluding with insight generation and evidence-based recommendations.

The analysis involved comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and reliability. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset, informing feature selection and modeling decisions. Statistical techniques and supervised machine learning models were applied to evaluate key drivers and predict outcomes relevant to the research objectives.

Model performance was assessed using appropriate validation techniques and evaluation metrics to ensure robustness and interpretability. Results were translated into actionable insights, with a focus on clarity and relevance for non-technical stakeholders. Visualizations and summary tables were used to support findings and communicate results effectively.

This project highlights strengths in analytical reasoning, research design, and technical execution, as well as the ability to bridge quantitative analysis with strategic insight. The capstone reflects proficiency in Python-based data analysis, applied machine learning, and professional documentation, demonstrating readiness for data-driven roles in research, analytics, and applied science.
