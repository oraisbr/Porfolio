# Bachelor Capstone – Food Inflation Forecasting

## Overview
This bachelor-level capstone project analyzes rising food costs in the United States
and forecasts future food prices using time series modeling. The project was completed
as part of an undergraduate data analytics program and demonstrates applied statistical
reasoning, forecasting, and data-driven decision support.

The analysis was framed around a fictional nonprofit organization seeking to plan for
future growth in response to increasing food insecurity caused by sustained food
inflation.

## Research Question
If food prices continue to rise at the current rate, what will the cost of food be
five years from now, and how should nonprofit organizations prepare to meet increased
community needs?

## Dataset
- Source: USDA Weekly Retail Food Sales Data
- Timeframe: 2019–2023
- Data Type: National-level weekly food sales totals and subcategories
- Format: Excel converted to CSV for analysis

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time series preprocessing and validation
- Stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- ARIMA modeling for forecasting future food costs
- Visualization of historical trends and forecasted outcomes

## Key Techniques
- Time series analysis
- ARIMA forecasting
- Statistical significance testing
- Data visualization for stakeholder communication

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, pmdarima, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel

## Outcomes
- Forecasted average food cost increases over a five-year horizon
- Projected inflation impact on staple food subcategories (e.g., eggs, poultry)
- Actionable insights to support nonprofit planning and funding strategy

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical modeling and forecasting
- Applied econometric techniques
- Analytical documentation
- Translating data into organizational decision support

## Notes
This project represents foundational academic work and demonstrates early proficiency
in time series modeling and applied analytics.
