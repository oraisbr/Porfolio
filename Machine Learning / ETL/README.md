# Machine Learning & ETL Projects

## Overview
This folder contains applied machine learning and data pipeline projects that demonstrate
end-to-end workflows from raw data ingestion to model-ready datasets and predictive modeling.
Projects emphasize interpretability, evaluation, and responsible use of machine learning.

## Objectives
- Build reproducible data pipelines for analysis and modeling
- Apply supervised learning techniques to real-world datasets
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Translate model outputs into actionable insights

## Project Types
- **Supervised Learning Models**  
  Classification and regression models developed using structured datasets, with a focus on
  feature engineering, validation, and performance assessment.

- **ETL Pipelines**  
  Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflows designed to prepare raw data for downstream
  analysis and machine learning applications.

## Methods & Techniques
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train/test splits and cross-validation
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Pipeline automation and data transformation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Applied machine learning
